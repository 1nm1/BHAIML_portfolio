# Improving Marketing Campaign Efficacy

## Intro / Context

Due to an overwhelming and increasing number of marketing campaigns and economic challenges, marketing organizations are increasingly using alternative approaches to increase impact including more targeted campaigns and the use of Business Intelligence and Data Mining. In this use-case, we are examining data related to targeted marketing campaigns around long-term deposit applications with good interest rates.

Similar to other exercises, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology is deployed here and includes the following steps:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Documents

You may find the solution notebook [here](./module_17_notebook.ipynb). Images saved during the analysis can be found in the images folder. The included PDF offers a similar analysis to the same dataset and is referenced throughout the analysis conducted here.

## Setup and Running Jupyter Notebook

To begin, install the required packages provided in the requirements.txt file (preferably in a dedicated environment)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then when you open the notebook, add this environment as your kernel. You will have the necessary libraries to run the notebook.

## Summarized Findings and Next Steps

# FINISH TODO

The findings here are included as a summary. For all findings and a full analysis, please see the Conclusions section in the notebook.

Year and odometer seem to have a profound impact on the price of the car. There are a few exceptions such as diesel vehicles, some trucks, etc. These anomalies could be targeted for maximizing revenue/profit. Based on the year and odometer, the company should target newer cars as well as 'classic' cars from the 50's and 60's. In both cases, the lower the odometer the better.
