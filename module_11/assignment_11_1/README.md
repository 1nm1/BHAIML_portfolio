# Used Car Sales - Price Prediction and Business Impact

## Intro / Context

In this exercise, we analyzed a dataset of used car sales via the CRISP-DM method. The CRISP-DM method stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining and includes the following steps:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

This is a standard approach for developing and deploying data science and/or machine learning solution. Likewise, this method was applied here and is outlined in the notebook found [here](./assignment_11_1_notebook.ipynb)

## Setup and Running Jupyter Notebook

To begin, install the required packages provided in the requirements.txt file (preferably in a dedicated environment)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then when you open the notebook, add this environment as your kernel. You will have the necessary libraries to run the notebook.

## Summarized Findings and Next Steps

The findings here are included as a summary. For all findings and a full analysis, please see the Conclusions section in the notebook.
