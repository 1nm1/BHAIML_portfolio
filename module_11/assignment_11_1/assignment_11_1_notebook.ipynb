    "In this notebook, we are inspecting, analyzing, and modeling the price of used cars. Through this exercise, we will understand the important factors that determine the price of a used car and how we can apply these learnings to make an overall impact to the business. In the notebook below, I am following the CRISP-DM methodology with sections clearly outlined. This is also supplemented by a README doc which includes setup, a summarized report, and final take-aways. \n",
